Pygame is required for the Graphical User Interface part of the game, hence to install that, type the following command in your terminal Once in the directory for the project, 

run pip3 install -r requirements.txt

[I have checked it in Linux and MacOS environment, Do the equivalent thing in Windows as well]

Then, run the "runner.py" program to play to game, an extra window will pop up, once you start this program. 

For example, in Linux, it will be "python3 runner.py"

Just in case, You must have  Python Version 3.5 or higher. This code will not be supported in Python 2.x.

ENJOY!!!
